# CodeKitchen - Educational Programming Game

An interactive, culinary-themed platform for learning programming fundamentals through cooking-inspired challenges.

## üç≥ Project Overview

CodeKitchen transforms coding education into an engaging culinary adventure where students learn programming concepts by "cooking up code." Players progress from basic prep cook tasks to advanced chef-level challenges, mastering programming fundamentals through recipe creation, kitchen management, and food-themed coding problems.

### Culinary Theme Integration
- **Variables** become **Ingredients** (storing quantities, types)
- **Functions** become **Recipes** (reusable cooking procedures)
- **Loops** become **Cooking Techniques** (repetitive actions like stirring)
- **Conditionals** become **Taste Tests** (if/else decision making)
- **Arrays** become **Ingredient Lists** (ordered collections)
- **Objects** become **Menu Items** (structured data with properties)

## üé® Design Principles

### UI/UX Guidelines
- **Warm Color Palette**: Creams, sage greens, golden ambers, and soft oranges
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear progression paths and visual hierarchy
- **Culinary Iconography**: Food emojis, cooking utensils, and kitchen metaphors
- **Encouraging Feedback**: Positive reinforcement with cooking success themes
- **Clean Typography**: Readable fonts that don't overwhelm beginners

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full accessibility without mouse
- **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for text readability
- **Font Scaling**: Responsive text sizes for different devices
- **Focus Management**: Clear visual focus indicators

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts from 3-column desktop to single-column mobile
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large buttons and interactive elements
- **Code Editor**: Mobile-optimized textarea for touch typing
- **Navigation**: Collapsible menus and intuitive mobile UX

### Animation System
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover effects on cards and buttons
- **Progress Animations**: Smooth XP bar and level progression
- **Success Celebrations**: Cooking-themed success animations
- **Transition Effects**: Smooth page transitions and modal appearances
- **Performance Optimized**: CSS transforms for smooth 60fps animations

## üîß Implementation Details

### State Management Approach
- **React Context**: Global game state (level, XP, completed challenges)
- **Local State**: Component-specific state (code editor, current challenge)
- **Persistent Storage**: LocalStorage for progress persistence
- **Query State**: React Query for any future API integrations

### Code Execution and Safety
- **Sandboxed Evaluation**: Safe JavaScript execution using Function constructor
- **Limited Scope**: Restricted to educational functions (print, basic math)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages with educational context
- **Output Capture**: Custom print function captures output for display
- **Security**: No access to DOM, network, or sensitive browser APIs

### Performance Optimization
- **Component Memoization**: React.memo for expensive components
- **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting for different game sections
- **Asset Optimization**: Optimized images and minimal bundle size
- **Efficient Rendering**: Virtual scrolling for large challenge lists
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers
